Based on the experiments with minSupport = 0.006 and minConfidence = 0.006 compared to minSupport = 0.003 and minConfidence = 0.003, it is concluded that a very high minimum support or confidence may result in too few rules to be of any practical use, while a very low minimum support or confidence may result in a large number of weak or spurious rules."
